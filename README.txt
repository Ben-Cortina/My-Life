Description
    The purpose of this game is to help educate the user on financial responsibility.
The game simulates a college students financial life by having him manage a credit
card, cash, and bank account. Every game day the user will be presented with events
that he/she needs to complete. Before the user can advance to the next day, all event
must be taken care of and the user must take a quiz. This quiz prompts the user to
answer a finance management based question. This was a C# XNA project I had to create
for a class.
